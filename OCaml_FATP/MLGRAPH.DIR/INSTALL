               INSTALLING MLGRAPH  LIBRARY for OBJECTIVE CAML



I   - FROM A COMPLETE DISTRIBUTION (ON A UNIX SYSTEM)
II  - TESTING MLGRAPH
III - UNINSTALLING MLGRAPH
IV  - FROM A BINARY DISTRIBUTION (ON A UNIX, WINDOWS 95/NT,  SYSTEM)

I - FROM A COMPLETE DISTRIBUTION (ON A UNIX SYSTEM) : 

1- Edit the file Makefile. Change the variable definitions at
the beginning of the Makefile, to indicate which Caml compiler (MLC) to use,
and where to install files (LIBDIR). See the machine-specific hints at the end
of this file.

2- If you select another directory than the Caml-light standard directory
   (/usr/local/lib/ocaml), then 

   a - edit the file prelude.ml and change  the variable 
       graphics_directory to indicate the good directory.

   b - edit the file mlgraph and change the string value 
       directory_concat_string and the string argument given to 
       change_graphics_directory function.


3- From the working directory, do: 

     make library


4- If you want to use the shell script mlpictex (which runs automatically
   the toplevel Caml and MLgraph), you need too to indicate the good 
   directory. Edit the file mlpictex and change the variable definition 
   CAMLLIBDIR.


5- You can now install the MLgraph library. This will create the following
   files and directories (in the directory set to LIBDIR in Makefile): 

       mlgraph.cmo    : the object file
       mlgraph.cmi    : the  object interface file
       mlgraph.cma    : the library object file
       mlgraph      : the include file
       MLgraph.lib  : the informations directory
                       which includes three  subdirectories : 
         Bin : commands directory
         Fonts : informations about fonts
         Headers : headers for PostScript and LaTeX
         Lib : headers and font descriptions in ML

   From the working directory do : 

       make install   
     

   
6- Installation is complete. Time to clean up.

   From the working directory do :

       make clean




II - TESTING MLGRAPH 

1- From the working directory : 

   load a objective caml session.

2- Do : 
  
   #use "mlgraph";;

3- Load : 

   #use "visages.ml";;

4- You can visualize the PostScript file visages.ps. 


If  something goes wrong :

1- If you cann't load the library MLgraph.zo when you include it : 
   
   a- Check if files MLgraph.zo and MLgraph.zi exist.

   b- Be sure to have the same camllight version between the camllight
      batch  compiler and interactive toplevel.

2- If you cann't read files from  MLgraph.lib directory :

   a- Check the variable directory_concat_string in the file mlgraph

   b Check the change_graphics_directory argument (i.e. the MLgraph library 
   directory) in the file mlgraph. 
  
4- If you cann't write the PostScript file : 

   a- Check your rights on this directory.


5- If you cann't visualise the PostScript file /tmp/visages.ps, 
   
   a- Check the visages.ps file size (about 7Kb).

 
In a desesperate case, you can write to the authors at the following 
address :  mlgraph@ens.fr


III - UNINSTALLING MLGRAPH  

1- Go to the working directory, and do : 

       make uninstall 



IV  - FROM A BINARY DISTRIBUTION (ON A UNIX, DOS, MAC SYSTEM)


1- Edit the file mlgraph and change the string value 
   directory_concat_string and the string argument given to 
   change_graphics_directory function. 

   
   
2- Copy  the following files and directories to the directory indicated 
   in the file mlgraph : 


       mlgraph.zo   : the library object file
       mlgraph.zi   : the library object interface file
       mlgraph      : the include file
       MLgraph.lib  : the informations directory
                       which includes three  subdirectories : 
         Bin : commands directory
         Fonts : informations about fonts
         Headers : headers for PostScript and LaTeX
         Lib : headers and font descriptions in ML
